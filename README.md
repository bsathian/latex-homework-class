# LaTeX Homework Class

Instead of title, author and date, this class uses course, homework and name

course : Name of the course
homework : Title for the Homework (example : Homework 1, Programming Assignment 1)
name : Name of the student

These also get reflected in the header

Use \maketitle inside document environment

Answers should go inside \begin{question}...\end{question}. This takes care of question numbering
and formats the answer by giving appropriate vertical spaces, in addition to drawing a small horizontal
line at the end
